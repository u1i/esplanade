# Project Esplanade

Project Esplanade is an AI-driven system for piano players, specially optimized for baroque music. Esplanade helps pianists practice by providing sophisticated audio analysis and feedback, tailored to the unique challenges of baroque music.

Esplanade is powered by advanced machine learning algorithms, which have been trained on a large dataset of baroque music. This allows it to understand the intricate nuances of Baroque music, and provide useful feedback and suggestions to help pianists improve their performance.

Esplanade is currently in development and not yet available for public use. We are working hard to make it available to the public soon. In the meantime, please check our website for updates, and follow us on social media for the latest news.

Key features of Esplanade include:

* Audio analysis and feedback tailored to Baroque music
* Automated analysis and feedback for a variety of playing styles
* Real-time monitoring of performance for immediate feedback
* A library of Baroque pieces for practice and performance
* Personalized practice suggestions and recommendations

We believe that Project Esplanade will revolutionize the way pianists practice and perform Baroque music. We are excited to see what the future holds for this project and look forward to its successful launch.
